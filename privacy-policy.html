                        digital representations of virtual coins that have no value <strong>(“FLASH”).</strong></p>

                    <p>Protecting the privacy of users of this web site (the <strong>“Site”</strong>) is important to us. This
                        privacy policy (the <strong>“Privacy Policy”</strong>) sets out the general terms by which the Flashnet
                        collects, stores and discloses personal information on this Site. From time to time, Flashnet may

                                to Flashnet. This information may include, for example, name, mailing address, Email address,

                            <p>Like most standard web site servers we use log files. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses,
                                browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time
                                stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement
                                in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses,
                                etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information unless you instruct us to complete
                                an application for services from one of our Suppliers in which case we will log your IP address
                                together with other information submitted on such an application form. This Site may use
                                cookies or web beacons solely to aggregate information about the pages users visit so we
                                can update and redesign, as necessary, our Site.</p>
                            <p>From time to time, however, we may disclose this information to fulfill legal or regulatory obligations
                                or if we determine such disclosure is legally advisable or necessary to protect our rights
                                and the rights of others, or to prevent harm. In addition, we may aggregate data about users
                                of our site and use it for statistical purposes.</p>

                            <p>Privacy and Security are Flashnet Priorities</p>
                            <p>We take every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information
                                via the Site, their information is protected both online and off-line. Only employees or
                                consultants, if any, who need the information to perform a specific job are granted access
                                to personally identifiable information. Our employees and consultants, if any, must use password-protected
                                screen-savers when they leave their Flashnet portal. When they return, they must re-enter
                                their password to re-gain access to user information. Furthermore, all employees and consultants,
                                if any, are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. As well, any time new
                                policies are added, our employees and consultants, if any, are notified and/or reminded about
                                the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our users' information
                                is protected. Finally, the servers that store personally identifiable information are in
                                a secure environment, in a locked facility. If you have any questions about the security
                                at our Site, users can send an email to Site at the address provided at the contact section
                                of this site.</p>
                            <p>Flashnet may disclose personal information collected online to third parties as well as our affiliates
                                who assist us with obtaining or supplying services to you that you have requested. In some
                                cases, this may require your information to be sent to other countries. By supplying your
                                information on this Site, you consent to your information being transferred across national
                                borders to Flashnet and third parties.</p>
