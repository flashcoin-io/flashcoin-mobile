These are legally binding terms of use between you (“<strong>User</strong>”) and Flashnet Tech Inc., a Canadian corporation (“<strong>Flashnet</strong>”).  Please read this Agreement carefully.</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>FLASH Services</strong>
                            <p>1.1. <strong>Services.</strong>    The services of Flashnet (“<strong>Services</strong>”) consist of creating FLASH, maintaining the Ledger, providing access to the Wallet and recording Transactions, all as defined below and subject to the terms of this Agreement.</p>
                            <p>1.2. <strong>FLASH.</strong>  Flashnet has published a closed-loop, blockchain-based, virtual currency (“<strong>FLASH System</strong>”).  The FLASH System enables User to display a digital representation of a token for visual and entertainment purposes (each a “<strong>FLASH</strong>”).  FLASH can be displayed by User and transferred to other users that have accepted this Agreement (each “<strong>Another User</strong>”).  Flashnet shall exclusively own the FLASH System.  User’s interest in any quantity of FLASH shall only be a limited, cancellable, transferrable license to display the symbolic value thereof in their Wallet (as defined below).  Flashnet intends to publish 90 billion FLASH most of which will be given away at the discretion of Flashnet.  FLASH shall be published at the discretion of Flashnet in such quantities and having such characteristics as Flashnet may deem useful.  Flashnet makes no representations as to the quantity, quality or utility of FLASH.  FLASH has not real currency value, is not a security and shall have no value to User other than for entertainment purposes.</p>
                            <p>1.3. <strong>No Value.</strong>   FLASH has no real currency value.

So long as User is not in breach of this Agreement, User shall be granted a unique and private wallet accessible through the Service (“<strong>Wallet</strong>” or “<strong>Account</strong>”).  The Wallet shall enable User to display that quantity of FLASH that is associated with the User, such as it may be from time to time.  Flashnet shall provide User with access codes for the Wallet.  User may not disclose such codes or permit any third party to use them on penalty of forfeiting the whole of the Wallet.

In the event that taxes apply to any Transaction, User shall be responsible for the collection and remittance thereof.  Flashnet is not party to Transactions between User and Another User, other than to publish the corresponding changes in the corresponding Wallets.</p>
